### Gaussian process learning for nonlinear dynamics
This repository is associated with the preprint of "[Gaussian process learning of nonlinear dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12193)". 

This repository presents the implementation of four scenarios, including identification and estimation with an affine parametrization, nonlinear parametric approximation without prior knowledge, and general parameter estimation for a given dynamical system.
